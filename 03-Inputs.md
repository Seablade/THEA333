## Microphones
 - Construction Technique
 - Pickup Pattern

## Construction Technique
 - Dynamic
 - Condenser (Capacitor)
 - Ribbon
 - Carbon
 - etc.

## Dynamic Microphone
 - Speaker in reverse
 - Very durable
 - Not very accurate
 - Very common on live stages

## Condenser Microphone
 - Two metal plates seperated by airgap
 - Not very durable
 - Requires Power (Phantom Power)
 - Typically more accurate
 - Not uncommon on a live stage

## Ribbon Microphone
 - Thin metallic ribbon suspended between magnetic poles
 - Exceedingly Fragile (Can be damaged by air blasts)
 - Do NOT apply Phantom Power
 - Typically used for a distinctive warm characteristic

## Other Microphones
 - Carbon Microphones
 -- Two Elements seperated by packed carbon
 -- Not very accurate
 -- OLD, used in old phones
 - Other Microphones
 -- "Speakerphones" (Yamaha Subkick)
 -- Esoteric

## What is Feedback?
  Feedback is when the sound from the speakers (Typically monitors) is strong enough to be picked up by the microphones, resulting in a re-amplification of the same signal, which is then in turn picked up by the microphones, resulting in an infinitively growing loop.

## Pickup Pattern
 - Cardioid
 - Super/Hyper Cardioid
 - Omni-Directional
 - Figure 8

## Cardioid
 - Named for the heart shape
 - Picks up primarily in front and a fair amount to the sides
 - Monitor placement directly behind the Microphone
 - Proximity Effect

## Hyper/Super Cardioid
 - Tighter versions of the Cardioid Pattern
 - Less pickup to the sides
 - Slight pickup (Lobe) to the rear
 - Monitor placement at approximately 135 degrees to the rear, not directly behind
 - Proximity Effect

## Figure-8
 - Picks up directly to the side of the microphone, but not in the front or rear
 - Can allow for picking up two sources with one microphone (ie. Rack Toms)
 - Monitor placement in the 'front' or 'rear' of the microphone
 - Proximity Effect

## Omni-Directional
 - Picks up in all directions
 - No good place for monitors
 ... Does not have Proximity Effect

## DI Boxes

## Wireless Microphones
