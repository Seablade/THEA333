# Sound Reinforcement Basics

## Purpose of Sound Reinforcement System

Author presents these basic four requirements of a sound reinforcement system

 - Intelligibility
 - Fidelity
 - Power
 - Monitoring and Controllability

##  Simplified Purpose of Sound Reinforcement System

I tend to simplify the four requirements into just two:

 - Fidelity
 - Power

## Fidelity (Includes Intelligibility)
  Fidelity is the ability of the sound reinforcement system to recreate a sound accurately.  I believe this is going to include inteligibility, or the ability to understand what is being spoken.  If you have a high fidelity sound system, you should also be able to clearly understand what is said.

## Power
  The sound system needs to be able to produce a level of output high enough for it's needs.
   - Rock and Roll == Higher Power Required
   - Speech Reinforcement == Lower Power Requirements

## Why not monitoring and control?
  Some sound systems are designed in such a way that their operators are completely unaware of what is actually happening.  These are commonly installed in commercial and some house of worship situations, where the operator needs to just hit a button to turn things on, and know that it will do what they want.

 1. Psychoacoustics
 2. Environment
 3. Input Transducers
 4. Signal Processing
 5. Output Transducers

And we are going to add *interconnections* to this list.

## Psychoacoustics

Psychoacoustics has to do with how we hear.  We do not hear linearly, and various factors can change how we hear a sound.

## Environment

The environment is where we physically hear the sound.  If it is a noisy environment, it will affect how we hear the sound and the power needed to overcome the noise to hear the sound clearly.

## Input Transducers

Input Transducer: Converts Acoustic Energy into Electrical Energy

Examples: Microphones, Pickups, etc.

## Signal Processing

Signal Processing: Anything that affects the quality of the electrical signal representing the acoustic sounds.

Examples: Mixers, FX Processors, Dynamics (Compressor/Expander), etc.

## Output Transducers

Output Transducers: Converts electrical energy into Acoustic Energy

Examples: Speakers

## Interconnects

Interconnects: The cabling and signaling carried on it that connects the various pieces of equipment.

Examples: XLR Cable, Speaker Cables, TosLink Cables, etc.
