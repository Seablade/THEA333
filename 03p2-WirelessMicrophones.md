## Wireless Microphones
 - Allow a performer to move across the stage unimpeded by wires
 - Have many more possible points of breakage than a wired connection

## Wireless Microphones - *Frequency Coordination*
 - One Transmitter to One Receiver
 - One Frequency to each Transmitter and Receiver
 ... The more microphones you add the more you have to worry about _intermodulation_

## Wireless Microphones - *Interference*
- We are Part 15 users of the UHF spectrum
- We must not generate any interference, a- We are Part 15 users of the UHF spectrum
nd must accept interference from everyone else
- Other users of the spectrum can include:
 + Other wireless microphone users
 + TV Broadcasts
 + White Space Devices

## Wireless Microphones - *FCC*
 - The FCC Database is the single most important tool in your arsenal to predict frequencies in use.

## Wireless Microphones - *Intermod*
 - Two or more frequencies combine to create 'phantom' frequencies
 - Can be predicted by MATH!
 - Get exponentially more complex with each additional microphone

## Wireless Microphones - *Software*
 - Due to complexity of larger systems, software is often used
 - Masque IAS
 - Shure Wireless Workbench (*FREE*)
 - Sennheiser WSM
